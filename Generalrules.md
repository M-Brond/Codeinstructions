## 🔐 Secrets Management
- Store secrets (API keys, DB credentials) in `.env` files  
- NEVER expose secrets to client-side code  
- Add `.env` and other sensitive files to `.gitignore`

## 📝 Documentation
- Always use Markdown for documentation and README files
Each repo must include a `README.md` with usage instructions, setup, and licensing
## 🧭 Project Initialization
- Every project must begin with an `instructions.md` file that clearly defines the end goal, scope, and features
