# Windsurf Global Rules

This file defines the global development standards for all Windsurf projects.  
It ensures consistency, maintainability, and clarity across codebases.
This is a work in process I'm just adding more when I find it is needed. 

## ðŸ“˜ Purpose
To provide a single source of truth for core rules related to:
- Secrets management
- Documentation practices
- Project planning structure
- File size and modularity
- Local development and testing
- Coding faster with AI by setting standards

## ðŸ“‚ Usage
These rules are intended to be:
- Followed by all contributors
- Enforced via linting, CLI checks, or CI
- Extended as the project and tooling evolve

## ðŸ“Œ Location
Stored in `.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md`.

## ðŸ›  Extending This
For feature-specific rules (e.g., component naming, routing), create additional scoped rule files and reference this as the baseline.
